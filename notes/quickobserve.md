# Quck Observations
just some quick notes about stuff that im noticing as I research
not much ryhme or reason other than stuff I see as I go

---

## Observations
- The lines in a veronoi diagram must be equal distant to two sites
- All points in a diagram cell are closest to the site that shares that cell
- Theres lots of circle optimization problems that keep getting hinted at
	- e.g. waste optimization problems
	- seems to be like circles, which is in the assignment description
	- **further research required**
